Note to grader: 
- Program was designed to run in a Linux environment 
to take advantage of Linux-style EOF markers for parsing text input.
- Program has been tested and run successfully on remote-linux.eos.ncsu.edu servers
- Please run my program using input redirection, there are no prompts.
In accordance with Effat's post on the Moodle forum, I chose to design my program
to use command line redirection rather than terminal prompts.

Thanks!
